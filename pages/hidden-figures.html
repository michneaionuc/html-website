                Based on the true story of three African American women—<strong>Katherine Johnson</strong>, 
                <strong>Dorothy Vaughan</strong>, and <strong>Mary Jackson</strong>—who worked as mathematicians 
                at NASA during the 1960s.<br>
                
                The film highlights their critical contributions to the success of the U.S. space program, 
                particularly <strong>John Glenn's orbital mission</strong>, while they faced 
                <em>racial and gender discrimination</em>.<br>
                
                Celebrating their brilliance and perseverance, <strong>Hidden Figures</strong> 
                showcases their fight for <em>equality and recognition</em> in a predominantly white and male workplace.
