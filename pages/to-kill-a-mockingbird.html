                In the Depression era, <strong>Atticus Finch</strong>, a lawyer, sets out to defend a <strong>Black man</strong> 
                accused of raping a white woman. The story highlights the deep-seated prejudice and 
                <em>discrimination present in society</em>, particularly through the wrongful accusation 
                and trial of <strong>Tom Robinson</strong>, a Black man.<br>
                
                Additionally, it explores themes of <strong>empathy</strong>, <strong>moral growth</strong>, 
                and the <em>importance of understanding others</em>, as seen through the experiences 
                of <strong>Scout</strong> and <strong>Jem Finch</strong> as they navigate their childhood in 
                a prejudiced world.
