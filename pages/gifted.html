                The film follows <strong>Frank Adler</strong> (played by <strong>Chris Evans</strong>) as he raises 
                his gifted niece, <strong>Mary</strong> (portrayed by <strong>McKenna Grace</strong>), after the 
                tragic death of her mother. Mary exhibits extraordinary mathematical talent at a remarkably 
                young age.<br>
                
                As Frank strives to give her a normal childhood, he faces a challenging legal battle against 
                her estranged mother's family, who believe that Mary should be placed in a more rigorous 
                academic environment. The film delves into profound themes of love, family dynamics, and 
                the pressures of exceptional intelligence, ultimately emphasizing the 
                <em>importance of prioritizing a child's happiness over societal expectations</em>.
