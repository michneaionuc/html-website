                After a <em>beggar saves a depressed psychologist from suicide</em>, they develop a 
                unique friendship that helps both of them gain strength and confront life's challenges 
                more effectively.<br>
                
                The story illustrates that while dreams and aspirations are essential for motivation and 
                hope, relying solely on them can lead to disillusionment and an evasion of real-life 
                obstacles.<br>
                
                Ultimately, the film emphasizes that <em>true fulfillment arises not from fleeting dreams 
                but from facing one's reality and taking concrete steps toward achieving personal goals</em>.
